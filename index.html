        Small Solutions is a game based on The Thing From The Future, a
        speculative design game by Stuart Candy and the late, great Jeff Watson.
        It has been expanded and changed to reflect readings in the class I
        teach, Interaction Design, which is less interested in the future than
        in the now that lasts forever. In 2014, speculative design was having a
        real Moment - we had Dunne-Raby's work on speculative everything, Thomas
        Thwaites' Toaster Project, and a lot of work with DIY. In the years
        since, it has become increasingly difficult to picture a future where
        small optimisms can crush large collapses - and Thing From The Future in
        my classrooms reflects that. Since it's a class on interactions and app
        design, the futures on offer are constrained to the screen. Since it's a
        professional development class, they're constrained to the imagination
        of the students playing - but more importantly, since the game was
        popular, the world's had the shutdowns Dunne-Raby couldn't picture
        happening in Speculative Everything. I have never run a game of Thing
        From The Future in my classes in the DMV where students didn't
        independently invent waterboarding, credit scores substantially worse
        than those we already face, or cars that are substantially more
        difficult versions of the cars that currently kill people in testing.

        note: for me, gamerGate, for everyone else, high point of tech funding
        weird nothing con projects that were pretty speculative! It was an era
        of Uber for Cats/the Juicero/Thanatos!
      </div>
      <div>
        This game is fun but how do we play it using the principles we see in
        design museums: accessible public services, better care for disabled
        people, etc. This game tends to generate juiceros! I would prefer it
        generate ideas about how to improve one's home without shopping.
      </div>
      <div>also it is entirely missing LLMs and generative prompts etc.</div>
      <div>
        Put simply, being cheerfully optimistic is a context-dependent utopia.
        The tool can be great, but like the two marshmallows, it relies on the
        students having a future they can picture that's good, and right now,
        ten years later, that is hard to perceive.
      </div>
      <div>
        Therefore, I have written this web-based version of the game for a
        different future, based not only on the speculative works of Dunne-Raby
        and Situation Lab, but also the narrow but real change brought about by
        design professors at Olin College.

        This game is intended to be played after reading Sara Hendren's essay
        "Limb," from her excellent book "What Can A Body Do? How We Meet The
        Built World." It is intended to let students consider small-scale
        interventions on their way to bigger lives.
